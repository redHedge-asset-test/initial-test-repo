1. focus on reegression
2. get github working
3. get python working
4. get old spreadsheets to desk



## regression

1. This is important for current methods.
2. initial check show that data not updating - need to look into this
3. existing spreadsheet is verbose for data:
    daily lists for 2 years > 500 lines per item)
    this is suboptimal => each needs to be 1 cell per list.
4. matrix to bve produced.
    question.  how useful will this be ?
5. Automation:
    key gain is that desk membersd should not have to maintain the data (in any way whatsoever)
