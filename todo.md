1. focus on reegression
2. get github working
3. get python working
4. get old spreadsheets to desk



## regression

1. This is important for current methods.
2. initial check show that data not updating - need to look into this
3. existing spreadsheet is verbose for data:
    daily lists for 2 years > 500 lines per item)
    this is suboptimal => each needs to be 1 cell per list.
4. matrix to bve produced.
    question.  how useful will this be ?
5. Automation:
    key gain is that desk membersd should not have to maintain the data (in any way whatsoever)



## get github working
github is an excellent resource for programmingang, building and sharing
it is open source. However, many large hedge funds and companies use it privately (paid mode)

take a look: **excellent resource**

1. test all of this out
2. plan for a team


### get python working
currently working on this

have looked into languages for the purpose of development outsidfe of excel
there are 4 suitable languages.


1. c++
bloomberg works naturally with this language.
    positve: it is fast (processing), it is robust
    negative: slower to build in

2. java
bloomberg has API this language.
    positve: it is fast (processing), it is robust, can build independent GUI (slow)
    negative: slower to build in

3. python
bloomberg has API this language.
    positve: popular for math, science, can build independent GUI (slow, but have done)
    negative: higher level than c++

4. node.js / javascript)
it appears as though bloomberg has API for this, but less developed from what i could see
    positive: display on web / in browser easily (javascript)
    negative: the API appears less developed in this language


## get old spreadsheets to desk
have quite a bit of RV to show, some of which may be possible, others not.

1. upload files and ideas for the purpose of sharing
2. review strategies

note:
    in doing all of this i ended up trading full time (previous shops).
    we dont know if we want this to be the case.
